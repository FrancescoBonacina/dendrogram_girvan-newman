# dendrogram_girvan-newman
Module which implements useful functions to plot dendrograms of community detections performed by the Girvan-Newman algorithm on graphs.

`dendrogram_from_girvan_newman` requires python 3, it is designed around the `networkx` python library and it was tested using networkx 2.1.
The notebook in example also uses the `scipy` python library (version 1.4.1).

To use the code just download (or clone) the current project and add the file dendrogram_from_gn.py to the `PYTHONPATH` variable.
Alternatively add dendrogram_from_gn.py directly to the same directory of your project, then do the import:
```python
import dendrogram_from_girvan_newman
```
